# Election Analysis

## Project Overview
A Colorado Board of Elections employee has given you the following tasks to complete the election audit of a recent local congressional election.

1. Calculate the total number of votes cast.
2. Get a complete list of candidates who recieved votes.
3. Calculate the total number of votes each candidate recieved.
4. Calculate the percentage of votes each candidate won.
5. Determine the winner of the election based on popular vote.

## Resources
- Data Source: election_results.csv
- Software: Python 3.7.6, Visual Studio Code  1.60.1

## Results
The analysis of the election show that:
- There were 369,711 votes cast in the election.
- The total votes cast for each county were:
   - Jefferson: 10.5% with 38,855 votes
   - Denver: 82.8% with 306,055 votes
   - Arapahoe: 6.7% with 24,801 votes
- Denver had the largest quantity of votes with 306,055 votes.
- The candidates were:
    - Charles Casper Stockham
    - Diana DeGette
    - Raymon Anthony Doane
- The candidate results were:
    - Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the vote and 85,213 number of votes.
    - Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes.
    - Raymon Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the vote and 11,606 number of votes.

## Summary
After analysis of the data, this script can be used for their future elections to examine or anticipate certain reults. The code can be re-wrriten or added to find additional number sets, it all just depoends on what the reader wants to find. Future analysis could provide data regarding: 
1. Increasing voter turnout
2. Increasing demographic based turnout/registration 
3. Analysis of voter preference
4. Comparison of registered voter to voter turnout
Using modificatons to the variable code can help collect data from all different viewpoints to quickly and accurately get results.

## Challenge Summary
The overall challenege was a bit tricky for a person who's never used Python. Going back and re-reading the module and practicing with lists really helped me get comfortable and used to writing out the code.
